    <h2>This page is made only for you 🌸</h2>

    <p>
      I made this little space just to tell you how special you are to me.
      Not just because you are beautiful—but because of your heart,
      your kindness, and the effort you put into everything you do.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love how creative you are, especially when you make handmade flowers.
      Every petal you create carries patience, care, and love—
      just like the way you treat the people around you.
      Your hard work inspires me more than you know.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are gentle, genuine, and rare.
      The kind of person who makes ordinary days feel warm and meaningful.
      Talking to you makes me feel calm, motivated, and happy.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website may be simple,
      but it’s made from my heart—
      just like my feelings for you.
